# Vibbit for MakeCode

This repo ships one Vibbit runtime supporting both:

- `Managed` mode (school server with server-side API keys)
- `BYOK` mode (student/teacher brings their own key in the panel)

## Managed classroom flow

1. Teacher runs or deploys the backend (`apps/backend/`).
2. Teacher opens `/teacher`, signs in (Google or local/dev login), and saves an OpenAI-compatible API base URL + key.
3. Teacher creates a classroom and shares the 10-letter code (shown as `ABCDE-FGHIJ`, optionally via `/join/CODE`).
4. Students open Vibbit in MakeCode and enter the classroom code. The production package (`npm run package`) is code-only against `https://vibbit.tk.sg`; ordinary `npm run build` keeps Managed + BYOK.
5. Vibbit connects to `/vibbit/connect`, receives a short-lived session token, then calls `/vibbit/generate`.
6. Provider keys stay on the server (per classroom). Optional operator panel: `/admin?admin=<ADMINTOKEN>`.

## Supported keys and endpoints

### Managed mode

- Endpoint used by the extension:
  - `POST {BACKEND}/vibbit/generate`
- Session bootstrap endpoint:
  - `POST {BACKEND}/vibbit/connect`
- Teacher / admin endpoints:
  - `GET {BACKEND}/` (informational landing page)
  - `GET {BACKEND}/teacher` (teacher login + mint classroom codes)
  - `GET {BACKEND}/admin`
  - `GET {BACKEND}/admin/status`
  - `GET {BACKEND}/download/vibbit-extension.zip`
  - `GET {BACKEND}/bookmarklet`
  - `GET {BACKEND}/bookmarklet/runtime.js`
- Teacher classrooms accept OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, or a custom OpenAI-compatible base URL (LiteLLM / Claude-compatible proxies). Custom public hosts require `VIBBIT_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_ALLOWLIST`; localhost/private gateways need self-hosted mode plus `VIBBIT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=true`. The URL must expose a `/chat/completions` endpoint (or equivalent path normalised to `/v1`).
- Request payload supports:
  - `target`, `request`, `currentCode`, `pageErrors`, `conversionDialog`
  - optional managed overrides: `provider`, `model`

### BYOK mode

- OpenAI key -> `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Gemini key -> `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`
- OpenRouter key -> `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`

## Files

- `work.js`: primary runtime source (extension + bookmarklet)
- `dist/`: built extension output
- `artifacts/vibbit-extension.zip`: packaged extension
- `apps/backend/`: managed backend (classroom auth + provider proxy)

## Block compatibility guardrails

- Prompts for `micro:bit` prefer built-in icons (`basic.showIcon(IconNames.*)`) using canonical names from `pxt-microbit/libs/core/icons.ts` (for example `IconNames.Duck`).
- Runtime validation checks known enum members from `pxt-microbit` core enums (for example `Button`, `Gesture`, `TouchPin`, `DigitalPin`).
- Runtime validation checks argument counts for core block APIs (derived from `//% blockId` signatures) before accepting model output.
- Prompt guidance includes `blocks-test` style example shapes to bias towards code that decompiles cleanly to Blocks.

## Build extension

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs:

- `dist/content-script.js`
- `dist/manifest.json`

Build-time backend overrides:

```bash
VIBBIT_BACKEND="https://your-server.example" VIBBIT_APP_TOKEN="optional-token" npm run build
```

## Distribute extension (website + GitHub)

Extension packaging is built into the repo:

```bash
npm run package
```

Output:

- `artifacts/vibbit-extension.zip`

Website download route:

- `GET {BACKEND}/download/vibbit-extension.zip`

By default, that backend route redirects to the latest GitHub release asset:

- `https://github.com/tinkertanker/vibbit/releases/latest/download/vibbit-extension.zip`

To ship a new downloadable version on GitHub:

1. Push a release tag (for example `v0.2.1`).
2. GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/release-extension.yml` builds and packages the extension.
3. The workflow publishes release assets:
   - `vibbit-extension.zip` (stable filename for latest download URL)
   - `vibbit-extension-<tag>.zip` (versioned copy)
   - matching `.sha256` checksum files

Optional backend override:

- Set `VIBBIT_EXTENSION_DOWNLOAD_URL` to any custom hosted zip URL if you do not want to use GitHub release assets.

## Build bookmarklet distribution

For users who cannot install the Chrome extension, build bookmarklet artefacts:

```bash
npm run build:bookmarklet
```

Default output includes both managed and BYOK bookmarklets (matching the extension):

- `artifacts/bookmarklet/vibbit-runtime.js`
- `artifacts/bookmarklet/bookmarklet-managed.txt`
- `artifacts/bookmarklet/install-managed.html`
- `artifacts/bookmarklet/bookmarklet-byok.txt`
- `artifacts/bookmarklet/install-byok.html`

To emit managed-only output:

```bash
VIBBIT_BOOKMARKLET_ENABLE_BYOK=false npm run build:bookmarklet
```

Set the hosted runtime URL used inside the bookmarklet link:

```bash
VIBBIT_BOOKMARKLET_RUNTIME_URL="https://cdn.example.com/vibbit-runtime.js" npm run build:bookmarklet
```

Deploy `artifacts/bookmarklet/vibbit-runtime.js` to that URL, then distribute the generated bookmarklet text or install HTML.

## Backend-hosted bookmarklet (Railway-friendly)

The managed backend can host bookmarklet assets directly, so you can avoid a separate static hosting step:

- Installer page: `GET {BACKEND}/bookmarklet`
- Runtime script: `GET {BACKEND}/bookmarklet/runtime.js`

After deploying the backend, share `{BACKEND}/bookmarklet` with students who cannot install extensions.

## Release runbook

For coordinated extension, bookmarklet, and backend/site releases, use:

- `docs/release.md`

## Shared compat core

`work.js` (BYOK runtime) and `apps/backend/src/runtime.mjs` (managed runtime) share generated compat helpers from:

- `shared/makecode-compat-core.mjs`

Sync/check commands:

- `npm run sync:compat-core` updates the generated block in `work.js`
- `npm run check:compat-core` fails if the generated block is stale

## Run backend locally (teacher laptop)

```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
npm run backend:start
```

Default local URL:

- `http://localhost:8787`

On start, backend logs the classroom share line and admin path. Supply `VIBBIT_ADMIN_TOKEN` through the environment; the token is not printed.

If provider keys are not set in env, open `/admin?admin=<ADMINTOKEN>` and configure them in the Provider Setup form.

## Deploy backend (monorepo)

Supported hosted deployment target:

- Railway

Deploy button (placeholder until template is published):

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/REPLACE_WITH_TEMPLATE_CODE?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=vibbit)

See full backend setup and env docs here:

- `apps/backend/README.md`

Recommended teacher flow:

1. Open [Railway New Project](https://railway.com/new) and deploy from GitHub.
2. Set service root directory to `apps/backend`.
3. Add required env vars from `apps/backend/.env.example`.
4. Generate a public domain, mint a classroom code, and share the code (hosted extension students need only the code).

Cheapest hosted option:

- Use one Railway backend service only, attach a volume, and set `VIBBIT_STATE_FILE=/data/vibbit-state.json`.
- Set Railway hard usage limit to `$1`.

## Install extension in Chrome (unpacked)

Vibbit is not on the Chrome Web Store yet. Install it as an unpacked extension:

- Download the latest zip from `https://vibbit.tk.sg/download/vibbit-extension.zip`, or
- Build locally with `npm run build` and use `dist/`.

Then:

1. If you downloaded the zip, unzip it first.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the unzipped folder (or `dist/` for local builds) containing `manifest.json`.
6. For updates, rebuild/re-download and click **Reload** on the extension card.

## Browser-test checklist

1. Build/package:
   - `npm run package`
2. Confirm artefacts:
   - `dist/content-script.js`
   - `dist/manifest.json`
   - `artifacts/vibbit-extension.zip`
3. Managed checks after `npm run package` (hosted/code-only):
   - enter classroom code only (server URL hidden; baked `https://vibbit.tk.sg`)
   - generate and verify paste + `Revert`
   - test error-aware flow (empty prompt + page errors)
   - trigger conversion modal and verify retry + `Fix convert error`
4. BYOK checks after `npm run build` (neutral dual-mode):
   - mode toggle, provider + model + key
   - generation, paste, and error-context fixing
5. Reload extension and refresh MakeCode tabs after each build

## Playwright audits

- `npm run audit:smoke` -> deterministic UI smoke + screenshots
- `npm run audit:live` -> optional managed/BYOK live verification
- `npm run audit:install` -> install Chromium

Audit output:

- `output/playwright/audits/`

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid class code`: confirm teacher shared the current code from backend logs/env.
- `Request failed: Unauthorized`: check class code/session, or `APP_TOKEN`/`SERVER_APP_TOKEN` if using legacy token mode.
- `No code returned`: try a clearer prompt or switch model.
- `Monaco not found`: open an actual MakeCode project first.
- `CORS/network errors`: check `VIBBIT_ALLOW_ORIGIN`, deployment env vars, and provider API key configuration.
